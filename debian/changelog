invaders (1.0.0-12) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * Split 01-pointer-targets-differ-in-signedness.patch into two separate
    patches: 01-misspelling-loose.patch and 01-uint8-char.patch.
  * Rename 02-gcc-ldflags.patch to 02-build-flags.patch, clean up CFLAGS
    and LDFLAGS a bit (we don't need -m32 twice) and replace -Werror with -W.
  * 02-static-inline.patch: Replace "extern inline" with "static inline" in
    io.h to allow for non-optimized builds.
  * 04-change-colors.patch: Use PgUp and PgDown to toggle through the color
    palette and use a secret key to toggle "psychedelic mode". ;)
  * 05-pause.patch: Use "P" to pause and resume.
  * Add DEP-3 compliant headers to all patches.
  * Make debian/copyright DEP-5 compliant and update Debian packaging license.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.9.2.
  * Set Architecture to "any-i386 any-amd64" instead of a hard-coded list.

invaders (1.0.0-10) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stefan Potyra ]
  * Fix build failures if stack-protector is enabled by default,
    thanks to Kees Cook for the patches:
    + rename debian/patches/02-amd64.patch to 02-gcc-ldflags.patch
    + move -nostdlib to CFLAGS, as it's a compiler flag
    + use CFLAGS for linking as well (since gcc is used)

  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * debian/patches/02-gcc-ldflags.patch: Replace -fno-builtin with
    -ffreestanding, the latter implies the former and is even stricter.
  * debian/patches/03-reboot-on-esc.patch: New patch, perform a reboot
    when the ESC key is pressed. Relies on the keyboard controller available
    at port 0x64 (just as the whole game does anyway).
